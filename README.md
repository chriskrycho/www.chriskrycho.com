# www.chriskrycho.com

This is the static hosting for the domain www.chriskrycho.com (and also the bare chriskrycho.com domain). You will *not* find the actual content of my website here, though: it lives in a versioned subdomain:

- [ ] v1.chriskrycho.com (to be republished at that URL)
- [x] v2.chriskrycho.com
- [ ] v3.chriskrycho.com (to be republished at that URL)
- [x] v4.chriskrycho.com
- [x] v4.chriskrycho.com 

This site itself primarily exists to redirect the root page and the RSS and JSON feeds, so that users can always go directly to www.chriskrycho.com and also can keep their feed reader pointed at the same location, and it will rev automatically when I launch new versions of the site.

Because I adopted this strategy during the transition between the v4 and v5 versions of the site, it also includes redirect rules for all of the v4 content.
